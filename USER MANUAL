Usage Instruction
The Prototype was created with the use of Canva. This is because Canva is an interactive Prototyping Software/Website that can easily
be distributed to testers with the use of links sent by the developers. 
 
Sample Flow Login Page
Launch the styLEstapp and navigate to the login page. Look for the "Login" button at the middle part of the screen.

Sample Flow of Product Overview
The search bar at the top of the screen allows users to search for products by entering their name or description. 
To narrow down the search, filters like price range, brand, size, and color can be applied. Once the search query is entered and filters applied,
the app will display a list of products matching your criteria,
complete with thumbnails, brief descriptions, and prices. Users can easily browse through the results, tapping on each product to explore its details, customer reviews, and availability. 

Sample flow of Try on Page 
The styLEst app provides a unique shopping experience with a virtual try-on feature with a built-in model. 
Users select a clothing item from the catalog and tap on it to access the product details page. The virtual model automatically adjusts the item's appearance when worn, 
allowing users to customize the fit and placement. After making adjustments, a "Capture" button is available, allowing users to capture a snapshot of the model wearing the item.
This allows users to review the snapshot, make confident purchases, and share it with others for opinions or style showcase. 

Sample flow of Checking out Items
Start by accessing a shopping cart, where you'll see all the products you've added for potential purchase. When you're ready to organize and prioritize these items,
simply look for the "Add to Cart" option within the cart interface. This feature allows you to selectively move items or transfer your entire cart contents with just a tap,
ensuring flexibility based on your preferences.

Once you've chosen the items you want to transition, confirm your selection to move them to your shopping list. 
Navigate to your shopping list within the app, where you'll find everything neatly categorized and ready for your review. 
This feature not only helps you keep track of what you intend to purchase but also allows you to easily 
check details such as sizes, colors, or quantities before making decisions.
